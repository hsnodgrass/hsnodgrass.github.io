I may get around to writing about that someday, but today I wanted to write about the best feature of Caddy and how I got it working with HAProxy: automatic TLS via Let’s Encrypt.... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Converting Hex Strings to IP Addresses with Ruby</title><link href="https://hsnodgrass.com/posts/convert-hex-strings-to-ips-with-ruby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Converting Hex Strings to IP Addresses with Ruby" /><published>2021-01-30T17:00:00-07:00</published> <updated>2021-01-30T17:00:00-07:00</updated> <id>https://hsnodgrass.com/posts/convert-hex-strings-to-ips-with-ruby/</id> <content src="https://hsnodgrass.com/posts/convert-hex-strings-to-ips-with-ruby/" /> <author> <name>Heston Snodgrass</name> </author> <summary> This past week I found myself wanting to parse /proc/net/tcp using pure Ruby.

IP addresses and ports are represented in /proc/net/tcp as hexidecimal strings and I had no idea how to decode them to be human readable. TL;DR # Decode a hex string representation of an IPv4 ad... </summary> </entry> </feed>
